## Status of the project

Purpose of this project is to provide not only useful toolset but also personal sandbox to learn Go language and
techniques.
Because of this reason, I'll maintain the user-facing features as compatible as possible. However,
interfaces/frameworks/build process or coding conventions may change without notification.

If you want to engage this project as a committer, I'll consider forking my sandbox part to another place. Then let's
make it better together.
Or if you want to create your own toolbox, just fork it :)

## #872 - Output filter option

This feature allows you to filter the output of the command.
This is useful if you want to process the output in a specific format.
In addition, in some cases, data in JSON format contains more data.
If you want to retrieve such hidden data, this option will help you to extract it as a report.

For example, the command [dropbox team member list](https://toolbox.watermint.org/commands/dropbox-team-member-list.html) returns a list of team members.
JSON report contains raw data from the Dropbox API.
If you want to extract only the email address and the verification status of the team members, you can use the output filter option.

```bash
$ ./tbx dropbox team member list -output json --output-filter "[.profile.email, .profile.email_verified]"
["sugito@example.com", true]
["kajiwara@example.com", true]
["takimoto@example.com", false]
["ueno@example.com", true]
["tomioka@example.com", false]
```

Then, if you want to format this data as a CSV, you can use the `@csv` filter like this:

```bash
$ ./tbx dropbox team member list -output json --output-filter "[.profile.email, .profile.email_verified] | @csv"
"sugito@example.com",true
"kajiwara@example.com",true
"takimoto@example.com",false
"ueno@example.com",true
"tomioka@example.com",false
```

In case you want to test the output filter, you can run the command first without the output filter option.
The command will generate the raw JSON output.
Then, you can test the query the command [util json query](https://toolbox.watermint.org/commands/util-json-query.html) to test the query.

```bash
$ ./tbx dropbox team member list
watermint toolbox xxx.x.xxx

The report generated: /Users/YOU/.toolbox/jobs/20240824-012959.EHJ/report/member.csv
The report generated: /Users/YOU/.toolbox/jobs/20240824-012959.EHJ/report/member.json
The report generated: /Users/YOU/.toolbox/jobs/20240824-012959.EHJ/report/member.xlsx

```

In this case, the JSON report is generated in the path `/Users/YOU/.toolbox/jobs/20240824-012959.EHJ/report/member.json`.
You can use this file to test the output filter.
The report is generated in the JSON Lines format. You need to use the `-lines` option to read the file.

```bash
$ ./tbx util json query -lines -path /Users/YOU/.toolbox/jobs/20240824-012959.EHJ/report/member.json -query "[.profile.email, .profile.email_verified] | @csv"
"sugito@example.com",true
"kajiwara@example.com",true
"takimoto@example.com",false
"ueno@example.com",true
"tomioka@example.com",false
```

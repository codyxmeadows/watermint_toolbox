## #872 - Output filter option

This feature allows you to filter the output of the command.
This is useful if you want to process the output in a specific format.
In addition, in some cases, data in JSON format contains more data.
If you want to retrieve such hidden data, this option will help you to extract it as a report.

For example, the command [dropbox team member list](https://toolbox.watermint.org/commands/dropbox-team-member-list.html) returns a list of team members.
JSON report contains raw data from the Dropbox API.
If you want to extract only the email address and the verification status of the team members, you can use the output filter option.

```bash
$ ./tbx dropbox team member list -output json --output-filter "[.profile.email, .profile.email_verified]"
["sugito@example.com", true]
["kajiwara@example.com", true]
["takimoto@example.com", false]
["ueno@example.com", true]
["tomioka@example.com", false]
```

Then, if you want to format this data as a CSV, you can use the `@csv` filter like this:

```bash
$ ./tbx dropbox team member list -output json --output-filter "[.profile.email, .profile.email_verified] | @csv"
"sugito@example.com", true
"kajiwara@example.com", true
"takimoto@example.com", false
"ueno@example.com", true
"tomioka@example.com", false
```

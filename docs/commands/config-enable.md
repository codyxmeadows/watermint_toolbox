# Command `config enable` is moved

The command `config enable` is moved to `config feature enable`. Please use the new path.

This command is available at both paths during the transition period until the build released before 2024-04-01T00:00:
00Z. If you are using this version of the program, this command will continue to be available after this date.

Please see `https://github.com/watermint/toolbox/discussions/795` for more detail.
